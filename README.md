# Predicting-Loan-Chargeoff-Delinquency-
Loans are given with a 3-year payment structure. However, some borrowers stop making payments before the end of the 3-year term – this event is called chargeoff. No borrower has been tracked for the full 3 years; at most, some borrowers have been followed up to 730 days into their 1095-day loan period. I build a probabilistic model to predict what number of borrowers will commit chargeoff, using each borrower’s incomplete record of payment history.
